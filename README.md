##### Projects

For my final project of the Codaisseur Academy I created a Festival app. This is an app in which you can keep track of the acts you want to see at an evert, what stage day and time, the app also has functionality to be a planner of the event, changing artsm newfeed, crew members and keeping track of all large equipment needed.
